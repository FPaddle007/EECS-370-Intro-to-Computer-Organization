# EECS-370-Intro-to-Computer-Organization

This repository contains all of my completed materials for EECS 370 Fall 2022 term from the University of Michigan. This course has served as a foundation in my understanding of computer hardware concepts such as cache, pipelining, assembly, data hazards. Furthermore, I was able to really dive into the features in the C language.
